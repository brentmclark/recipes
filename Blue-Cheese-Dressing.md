## Ingredients

- 2 ½ ounces blue cheese crumbles
- 3 tablespoons buttermilk
- 3 tablespoons sour cream
- 2 tablespoons mayonnaise
- 2 teaspoons white wine vinegar
- ¼ teaspoon sugar
- ⅛ teaspoon garlic powder
- salt and freshly ground black pepper


## Method
In a small bowl, mash blue cheese and buttermilk together with a fork until mixture resembles large-curd cottage cheese. Stir in sour cream, mayonnaise, vinegar, sugar, and garlic powder until well blended. Season to taste with salt and pepper.

## Notes
- Whole milk may be used in place of buttermilk for a milder flavor. 
- Rice Vinegar is a fine substitute for the white wine vinegar.
