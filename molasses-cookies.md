# Soft Molasses Cookies  
*Adapted from: https://sallysbakingaddiction.com/soft-molasses-cookies/*

## Ingredients

- 2 1/4 cups (281 g) all-purpose flour  
- 1 1/2 tsp baking soda  
- 2 tsp ground ginger  
- 1 1/2 tsp ground cinnamon  
- 1/4 tsp ground cloves  
- 1/4 tsp ground nutmeg  
- 1/4 tsp salt  
- 3/4 cup (170 g) unsalted butter, softened  
- 1/2 cup (100 g) packed brown sugar  
- 1/4 cup (50 g) granulated sugar  
- 1/3 cup (80 ml) unsulphured or dark molasses (not blackstrap)  
- 1 large egg, room temperature  
- 2 tsp vanilla extract  

**For Rolling**

- 1/3 cup (about 67 g) granulated or coarse sugar

## Instructions

1. In a medium bowl, whisk together the flour, baking soda, ginger, cinnamon, cloves, nutmeg, and salt. Set aside.  
2. In a stand mixer with paddle attachment (or a handheld mixer), beat the butter, brown sugar, and granulated sugar on high speed until creamy, about 2 minutes.  
3. Add the molasses and mix until combined. Add the egg and vanilla; beat until fully incorporated, about 1 minute. Scrape down the sides as needed.  
4. Add the dry ingredients to the wet ingredients and mix on low until just combined. The dough will be sticky.  
5. Cover tightly and chill for at least 1 hour (up to 3 days).  
6. Preheat oven to 350°F (177°C). Line baking sheets with parchment or silicone baking mats.  
7. Scoop dough into balls (about 1 tablespoon each) and roll in the sugar. Place about 3 inches apart on baking sheets.  
8. Bake for 11–12 minutes or until the edges are set. If the tops haven’t cracked, remove the tray and bang it gently on the counter a few times, then return to the oven for 1 more minute.  
9. Cool on the baking sheet for 5 minutes, then transfer to a wire rack to cool completely.

## Notes

- Dough can be refrigerated up to 3 days before baking.  
- Baked cookies keep at room temperature for about 1 week.  
- Baked cookies freeze well for 3 months; thaw overnight in the fridge.  
- Dough balls (before rolling) freeze well for 3 months. Let sit 30 minutes at room temp before rolling in sugar and baking.
