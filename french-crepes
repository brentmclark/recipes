# Classic French Crepes

### Ingredients
- 1 1/4 cup milk 10 fl oz
- 3 large eggs
- 2 tbsp oil or melted butter
- 2 tsp sugar for savory crepes, OR
- 2 – 3 tbsp sugar for sweet dessert crepes
- 1/2 tsp kosher salt
- 4 oz all purpose flour scant 1 cup

### Instructions:

##### Mixing with a Whisk
1. Place the milk and eggs in a jug/bowl. Whisk to combine (you should have about 2 cups of liquid).
2. Add the oil or butter and whisk it in.
3. Place the flour, salt and sugar in a large bowl.
4. Add about 3/4 – 1 cup of the liquid and mix gently to form a smooth paste. This should not take more than a few seconds. Take care not to over-mix.
5. Add the rest of the liquid and mix to form a smooth, watery batter.
6. Cover the batter and let it rest for at least 20 minutes. The batter can be kept in the fridge overnight as well.

##### Mixing with a Blender
1. Add the ingredients into the blender. Add the flour last. Blend for a few seconds until you have a smooth batter. You can use a stick blender as well for this purpose.
2. Cover the batter and let it rest for at least 20 minutes. The batter can be kept in the fridge overnight as well.

##### Cooking the Crepes
1. Preheat a 10 inch non-stick pan over medium heat.
2. Brush a layer of butter on the heated pan. I used a silicone brush, but you can use a butter soaked paper towel or cloth as well.
3. Always mix the batter first, before you make each crepe. This is to make sure the batter is uniformly mixed.
4. Pour 1/4 cup of the batter into the hot pan, and swirl to coat the bottom of the pan. Swirl and spread the batter along the edge of the pan first and then fill the middle with the remaining crepe batter. Make sure the batter is as evenly spread as possible.
5. Place the pan back on the heat to let the crepe cook.
6. For extra soft crepes – cook the crepes only until they are just set at the surface (about 30 seconds) and there’s no browning on the edges. You can flip over the crepe gently, and cook for a few seconds on the other side (optional), or remove the crepe from pan and place it on a plate.
7. For classic crepes – cook the crepes until the edges are starting to brown become a little crisp (about 40 seconds). Flip the crepes over and cook for a further 10 – 15 seconds on the other side until the crepes have caramelized spots.
8. Repeat until all the batter is used up (remember to mix the batter each time).
9. Stack the cooked crepes on a plate or wire rack.

##### Serving
If the crepes are no longer warm when you’re ready to serve them, place another plate over your stack of crepes and microwave for about 30 seconds until the crepes are warm. Then remove the second plate quickly so that the crepes don’t become soggy with steam/moisture.
