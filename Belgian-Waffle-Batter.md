#Belgian Waffle Batter
Makes 8 waffles

###INGREDIENTS
- 3 eggs, separated
- 2 cups mils
- 5oz unsalted butter, melted and cooled
- 1.5 tsp. vanilla extract
- 2.25 cups [self-rising flour](http://allrecipes.com/recipe/149310/self-rising-flour/)
- 3 tbsp. [baker's sugar](http://www.bakepedia.com/baking-encyclopedia/bakers-sugar/) (although I have used granulated __and__ confectioner's sugar before, both with great success)

###METHOD

1.  Place egg yolks, milk, butter, and vanilla in a large bowl and whisk until well combined
2.  Combine Flour and sugar into a second, large mixing bowl and make a well in the center
3.  Carefully whisk in egg yolk-milk mixture to form a smooth batter
4.  Beat egg whites with electric hand mixer until stiff peaks form.  Gently fold egg whites into batter.

###COOKING INSTRUCTIONS

These instructions are specific to the Breville waffle maker. (Which is amazing, for the record)

1.  Select BELGIAN setting and set the browning control dial to setting 6.
2.  Preheat the waffle maker until the LCD color changes to orange and the word HEATING disappears from the display.
3.  Pour .5 cup of batter into each of the four waffle squares and close the lid to begin cooking.
4.  At the end of the cooking cycle, open the lid and carefully remove your waffles.
5.  Repeat with remaining batter
