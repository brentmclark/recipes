# Barbacoa

## Ingredients

- 3 lbs of chuck roast or round steak
- Salt and freshly ground black pepper
- 2 Tbsp vegetable oil
- 1 1/4 cups beef broth, divided
- 3 - 4 chipotle chilies in adobo (see [note](#notes) on spice levels below)
- 6 garlic cloves
- 1 1/2 Tbsp ground cumin
- 1 Tbsp dried oregano
- 1/4 tsp ground cloves
- 3 bay leaves
- 1/4 cup fresh lime juice

## Method

1. Cut roast into 6 portions while removing any large pieces of fat. Heat 1 Tbsp vegetable oil in a skillet. 
2. Dab roast dry with paper towels, season with salt and pepper (about 1 tsp salt 3/4 tsp pepper). Add 3 pieces to skillet and sear until browned on all sides. Transfer to a slow cooker.
3. Add the remaining 1 Tbsp vegetable oil to the skillet and repeat the process with the remaining 3 roast pieces. Nestle beef portions side by side in an even layer in the slow cooker.
4. In a food processor, pulse together chipotle chilies, garlic, and 1/4 cup beef broth until well pureed, occasionally stopping and scraping down the sides of the processor.
5. In a 2-cup liquid measuring cup or in a bowl, whisk together the remaining beef broth with chipotle mixture, cumin, oregano, and cloves. Pour mixture over beef in slow cooker, then nestle bay leaves between beef portions. 
6. Cover and cook on low heat for 8 - 9 hours.
7. Remove beef from slow cooker (leave broth) and shred. Stir lime juice into broth in slow cooker then return beef to slow cooker and cook on low or warm 20 - 30 minutes longer. 
8. Strain liquid from beef and serve in tortillas with desired toppings.

## Notes

1. Using round steak may require additional cooking time and/or beef broth
2. Skip the chipotle chiles if you don't like spicy.  You can add 4 tsp of chili powder or toss in a few mild, dried peppers to the food processor mix.
3. Check the meat after about 6 hours and add more beef broth if necessary.
4. In place of a slow cooker you can use a Dutch oven and bake at 250 degrees F.  In my experience, this produced better results.
