# Molasses Cookies

> Ultra-chewy molasses cookies from scratch — soft center and crinkled top.

## Ingredients

- Unsalted Butter | ¾ cup (170 g) | melted
- Dark Brown Sugar | 1 cup (200 g) | packed
- Molasses | ¼ cup (80 g) | unsulfured
- Egg | 1 large |
- Egg Yolk | 1 large | additional yolk for chewiness
- Vanilla Extract | 2 tsp |
- All-Purpose Flour | 2 ¼ cups (280 g) |
- Baking Soda | 2 tsp |
- Ground Ginger | 2 tsp |
- Ground Cinnamon | 1 ½ tsp |
- Ground Cloves | ¼ tsp |
- Salt | ¾ tsp |
- Granulated Sugar | ⅓ cup | for rolling

## Directions

1. In a medium bowl, whisk together the **melted butter** and **dark brown sugar** until smooth and glossy.  
2. Add **molasses**, **egg**, **egg yolk**, and **vanilla extract**. Whisk until fully combined.  
3. In a separate bowl, whisk together the **flour**, **baking soda**, **ginger**, **cinnamon**, **cloves**, and **salt**.  
4. Add the dry ingredients to the wet mixture and fold until just combined. Dough will be soft and sticky — this is ideal.  
5. Cover the dough and chill for **1 hour** (or up to 24 hours) to deepen flavor and prevent excess spreading.  
6. Preheat oven to **350°F (175°C)**. Line baking sheets with parchment paper.  
7. Scoop and roll dough into roughly 1.5-inch balls. Roll each ball in **granulated sugar** to coat.  
8. Arrange dough balls on the baking sheet, spacing them about **2 inches** apart.  
9. Bake for **9–11 minutes**, removing them as soon as the tops crack and edges look just set (centers should appear slightly underdone for maximum chewiness).  
10. Allow cookies to cool on the baking sheet for **10 minutes** before transferring to a wire rack.

## Notes

- Slight underbaking is key for a chewy texture.  
- The combination of melted butter, dark brown sugar, and an extra yolk maximizes chewiness.  
- Dark brown sugar and molasses provide a deeper, richer flavor than light brown sugar.  
- Chilling the dough helps maintain shape and enhances the spice profile.
